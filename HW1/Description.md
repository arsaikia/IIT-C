# Homework 1 : CS402 - Introduction to Advanced Studies II - Fall 2019

### We have two questions here : 
*  Q1 deals with plotting Histograms from two trace files - The implementation can be found under  /Files/HW1_Q1.ipynb
### > Download the file and open using jupyter notebooks. Alternately the HTML file can be used to check the Implementation.
*  Q2 deals with multiplying two randomly generated rectangular matrix - The implementation can be found under the Files/algo1.py & algo2.py
### > Download the files and run using python as : "python algo1.py"


__Reports:__

* Answers for both the questions can be found in the report file : `HW1_Report.pdf` (*Alternate `.docx` format is also available*)

__Files:__

Both the histograms and Screenshots of the algorithms execurions can be located under /Files folder

* `tex.txt` and `cc1.txt` : Input files for the Histograms
* `hist_tex.png` and `hist_cc1.png` : Histograms plotted on input files TEX and CC1
* `algo1_system1.png` and `algo1_system1.png` : Algorithm algo1 execution SS on System1 and 2
* `algo2_system1.png` and `algo2_system1.png` : Algorithm algo2 execution SS on System1 and 2

__Steps for Execution:__

*  `HW1_Q1.ipynb` can be opened using JUPYTER NOTEBOOK and each block of code can be excuted.
*  `algo1.py` and `algo2.py` : Run using "python algo1.py" from terminal.
